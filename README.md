# linuxTools
These are the tools that I've made for my Linux System. some of the tools require other tools like nmap to function.

# Brightness
this is a program that is supposed to fix the frightness function on linux systems. It gives options:

-set		sets an exact number for brightness (best to stay between 0.0-1.0)

-inc		increases the brightness by a given amount

-dec		decreases the brightness by a given amount

-get		gets the current brightness on the monitor

-blank	blank is a switch between 0.0 and 1.0

-bump		It periodically bumps the brightness from 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 and increases with every press until its reset back to 0.25


# Staticip
Its one purpose is to go to get the network static ip address for the router.
it goes through http://ipecho.net/plain


# ipsearch
this is an old script that may or may not work. I havent had time to test and fix it, but it is up to you to play with it and see if you can fix it.


# localip
gets the local ip address on the current network using hostname
